A user style for new google reader UI that makes you feel right at home.

### Why?
I spend a considerable amount of time everyday on Google Reader. In fact, for me, it's the most visited website according to my browser history. That's why I need it to look beautiful and pleasant to my eyes or at least does not make them hurt!
